The Story:

Yet again, the fate of the world rests in your hands!  An evil computer hacker, known only by his handle 'Bill', has created the ultimate computer virus.  A virus so powerful that it has the power to transmute an ordinary computer into a toaster oven.  (oooh!) 'Bill' has cloned himself into a billion-jillion micro-Bills.  Their sole purpose is to deliver the nefarious virus, which has been cleverly disguised as a popular operating system.

As System Administrator/Exterminator, your job is to keep Bill from succeeding at his task.
