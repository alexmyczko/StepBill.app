The rules and story windows now function correctly. And the drawing 
looks better too. I've also got the Localizable.strings files fixed. 
The method is this:

iconv -f utf-16 -t utf-8 Localizable.strings > temp.strings

and then from there you can use cvtenc to get the file into ascii 
encoding with unicode escape sequences.

cvtenv -EscapeOut YES temp.strings > Localizable.strings

I used utf-8 because that is my system default, and it should be a 
lossless conversion to go from utf-16 to utf-8. cvtenc by default 
converts from your system's default encoding to ascii, and back. There 
is an -Encoding switch for cvtenc that lets you use a different 
encoding. running cvtenc like so:

cvtenc -Encoding UTF-16 -EscapeOut YES Localizable.strings > 
temp.strings

should fix it in one step, but on my system this wouldn't work. I'm 
not sure what the problem was.

So, now there is Japanese. But only dialogs. The gorm file, rules.txt, 
and story.txt would all need to be translated for it to be complete. I 
may know someone who would be willing to do this. I'd have to check 
first.

If there is no desire to keep StepBill in sync with MacBill, the nib 
files, MacBill.plist, MacBill.icns, and InfoPlist.strings files could 
probably be removed. Some of those files are listed in the 
GNUmakefile, and would have to be deleted from there as well.
